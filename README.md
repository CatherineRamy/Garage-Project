# Garage-Project
ðŸš˜This is our Project for Introduction to Software Engineering ***CS251*** course.

## Description:
There are 5 main functions required in our project:
<br>
    1. park in <br>
    2. park out <br>
    3. see garage available slots <br>
    4. see total income <br>
    5. total number of cars used the garage <br>

## Steps:

### first step:
We started asking our customer "*TA*" some questions to clarify the requirements function, this is the first main goal in the first step
<br>The second main goal is to show the customer some unwanted functions and he chooses whether he wants to fix them or not
<br>The third main goal we started to draw a use case model using UML.
<br>All these are in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) ðŸ‘‰ <a href="https://github.com/CatherineRamy/Garage-Project/blob/6bde648932e30e2023a64cd62938867a7aeb36ca/CS251-SoftwareRequirementsSpecifications-SRS-Template-v2.0%20(1).docx">SRS file</a>
<br>

### second step:
After studying SOLID Principles and three Design patterns: Strategy, Adapter& Singleton  <br>
this file describes our using SOLID Principles and three Design patterns ðŸ‘‰ <a href="https://github.com/CatherineRamy/Garage-Project/blob/main/CS251-Design%20pattern%20and%20solid%20principles%20-v2.docx">SOLID Principles and Design patterns</a>
<br>
we started to draw Sequence diagrams& Class diagrams
All these are in the SoftwareDesignSpecifications (SDS) ðŸ‘‰ <a href="https://github.com/CatherineRamy/Garage-Project/blob/6bde648932e30e2023a64cd62938867a7aeb36ca/CS251-SoftwareDesignSpecifications-SDS-Template-v1.docx">SDS file</a>

### third step:
We developped the software application using *Java*.

## Test cases:

***To park in any vehicle user enters vehicle info and the system will display for him the available slot's ID*** <br><br>

***To park out any vehicle user enters the vehicle's ID and the system will display for him the fees*** <br><br>

***In this test case, there are four slots in the garage, and the client parked in two vehicles "because this the system display only two available slots"*** <br><br>

***When client enter vehicle's ID there isn't in the garage*** <br><br>
