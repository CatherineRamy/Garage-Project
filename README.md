# Garage-Project
ðŸš˜This is our Project for Introduction to Software Engineering ***CS251*** course.

## Description:
There are 5 main functions required in our project:
<br>
    1. park in <br>
    2. park out <br>
    3. see garage available slots <br>
    4. see total income <br>
    5. total number of cars used the garage <br>

## Steps:

### first step:
We started asking our customer *TA* some points to clarify the requirements function, this is the first main goal in the first step
The second main goal is to show the customer some unwanted functions and he chooses whether he wants to fix them or not
The third main goal we started to draw a use case model using UML.
All these are in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) ðŸ‘‰ <a href="">SRS file</a>
<br>

### second step:
After studying SOLID Principles and three Design patterns: Strategy, Adapter& Singleton
<br>
we started to draw Sequence diagrams& Class diagrams
All these are in the SoftwareDesignSpecifications (SDS) ðŸ‘‰ <a href="">SDS file</a>

### third step:
We developped the software application using *Java*.
